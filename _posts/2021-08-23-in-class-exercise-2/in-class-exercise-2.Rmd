```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

# Getting Started

## The following code chunk performs 3 tasks:

- Create a list of R packages needed
- Check if there are missing packages and install the package
- Load the package


```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
packages <- c('sf', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if (!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T) #loading the package
}

```
